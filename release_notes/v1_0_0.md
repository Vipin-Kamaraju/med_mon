## Release Notes for v1.0.0

### Key Features
- **Modular Filter Node**: Implemented a generic modular filter node for signal filtering. It's configurable via `rosparams` in the launch file, specifically designed to use `ekg` as input and `ekg_filter` as output.
- **GUI Enhancements**:
  - Added a toggle button to enable and disable filtering directly from the GUI.
  - Improved the overall layout of the GUI for better user experience.
- **Logging and Debugging**:
  - Enabled dynamic enable/disable of debug logs through `rosparam`.
  - Integrated `rqt graph` in the Docker image for enhanced visualization and debugging capabilities.
- **Script and Launch Improvements**:
  - Integrated the `roslaunch launch_files med_mon.launch` command into the `run_med_mon.sh` script, simplifying the process of starting the application.
  - Updated `run_med_mon.sh` to dynamically handle paths, removing the need for hardcoded values.
- **Docker Integration**:
  - The Docker container now automatically sources `/opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash`, removing the need for manual sourcing at each instance launch.
  - Downgraded QML imports to ensure compatibility with Qt version 5.12, addressing out of memory exceptions encountered with Qt version 5.15.4 during Docker builds.
- **Documentation**:
  - Added a sequence diagram to provide a visual representation of the project architecture and flow.
  - README file has been updated to reflect the latest changes and usage instructions.

### Future Improvements
- **Codebase Organization**:
  - Plan to refactor the folder structure for improved clarity and maintainability.
  - Propose organizing Docker-related files within `tools/docker/` to centralize and streamline Docker configurations.
- **Testing**:
  - Aim to add comprehensive testing and test scripts to enhance reliability and facilitate continuous integration.
